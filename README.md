BitCoin - Decentralized

1. How it is connected?

It is connected via P2P Network. Each device act as a Node.

2. What a Node can do?

A complete node can do folloqing four functions;.
i) W allet
ii) M iner
iii) B lockchain (Full BlockChain Database > 300 GB)  => Full Nodes and Subset of Node
iv) N etwork routing

i) Wallet
- User wallets might be part of a full node.


ii) Miner
- Mining Nodes compete to create new blocks by running specialized hardware to solve the proof-of-work algorithm.
- Can be either Full Node sor Half Nodes.

iii) BlockChain
- Full size of BlockChain exceeds 300 GB.
- Some Nodes have a full copy of BlockChain entire transctions. And can verify a transaction authoritatively.

- While some nodes only have a subset of BlockChain transactions known as lightweight or SPV Nodes. Do not have a full compy of BlockChain
* SPV (Simplified Payment Verification): SPV Nodes can verify transactions by external communication.

iv) Network Routing
- Main Bitcoin-P2P-Network, running the bitcoin P2P protocol, consists of between 7,000 and 10,000 listening nodes.
- Servers and Nodes running other network protocols than Bitcoin-P2P-protocol.
- These nodes act as network edge routers, allowing various other services 
- (exchanges, wallets, block explorers, merchant payment processing) to be built on top.


#Types Of BitCoin Networks

1. Reference Client (Bitcoin Core)
- A Wallet
- Miner
- Full Blockchain database
- And Network routing node on the Bitcoin P2P Network.

2. Full Block Chain Node
- Full Blockchain database
- And Network routing node on the Bitcoin P2P Network.

3. Solo Miner
- Miner
- Full Blockchain database
- And Network routing node on the Bitcoin P2P Network.

4. Lightweight (SPV) Wallet
- A Wallet
- And Network routing node on the Bitcoin P2P Network.

5. Pool Protocol Servers
- Gateway routers connecting the Bitcoin P2P network to nodes running other protocols such as pool mining nodes or Stratum nides.

6. Mining Nides
- Contains a Mining Function
- With a Stratum protocol node (S) or other pool (P) mining protocol node.

7. Lightweight (SPV) Stratum wallet
- A wallet
- A network on the Stratum
